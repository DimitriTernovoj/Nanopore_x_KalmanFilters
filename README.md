# Nanopore_x_KalmanFilters
The repository contains the code used in my master thesis "Segmentation of Nanopore Sequencing Data using Kalman Filter based Algorithms".
The code consists of the algorithms + statistics (provided in the KF_Algorithms folder), as well as scripts for execution and data generation. The data sets used in the thesis are also provided.
